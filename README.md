# Airport Database
## [Jacob Ko](github.com/tjacobko) and [Parth Mangrola](github.com/ParthMmm)

# Description:
This is a mock Airport Database system that utilizes a user interface capable of adding various entities, booking flights, listing available seats for a flight, listing number of repairs for certain planes, etc.

# Development:
We first utilized PreSQL techniques using an ER Diagram and a Relational Model. Then we were able to build our database and utilize queries and inserts within our Java Interface.
